To enable synthesis of FPGA/CPLD hardware, XST will assume that all necessary signals are present in the sensitivity list.

The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
	- add an &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">INIT</arg>&apos; attribute on signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="4">PREVIOUS_STATE</arg>&gt; (optimization is then done without any risk)
	- use the attribute &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="5">signal_encoding</arg> <arg fmt="%s" index="6">user</arg>&apos; to avoid onehot optimization
	- use the attribute &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="7">safe_implementation</arg> <arg fmt="%s" index="8">yes</arg>&apos; to force XST to perform a safe (but less efficient) optimization
